## User Stories
-   As a nurse I want to input data into my patient
-   As a nurse I want to be able to update the data because it constantly changes
-   As a doctor I want to know how my patients are doing based on and view based on seriousness
-   As a doctor, I want to see symptoms for the patient

## Technology Used
-  Handlebars
-  JavaScript
-  Node
-  CSS

## Process
Created auth and patient curl scripts and buttons for account access and patient creation. I tried to make the access easy for each user when creating Patient Resources

### Future Resolutions
There are some unresolved issues that I need to fix on the front end, such as the CSS and design of the outlook. The account settings (sign out, change password) should be smaller and displayed in a corner, and possibly add a background. The app could be more interactive with the user; however the essence of this application is its simplicity. By allowing the access and usability to be easy, the main users (doctors and nurses) can save time and work on other important issues.
